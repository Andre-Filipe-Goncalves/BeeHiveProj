                    <p><h2>Propolis</h2>An essential hive product, propolis has numerous beneficial properties for your body, but also for your skin. Rich in enzymes, amino acids and minerals, it is used in several forms to adapt precisely to your needs and your preferences.
                    Produced by worker bees, propolis is a mixture of resins collected from trees and salivary secretions. Defending the hive, propolis ensures it is sealed, protecting it from external bacteria.
                    Propolis offers numerous properties thanks to the multitude of substances that it contains.
                    As a construction and repair material: to bond, fill cracks and maintain an ideal temperature for the good health of the colony, but also to prevent predators from entering the hive.
                    As an antiseptic treatment: to allow a healthy environment for the development of broods.
                    The ideal period for collecting propolis is during the winter season, because at this time it is more easily removed from its supports.

                    <p><h2>Honey</h2>Honey is a pure product which combines plants and the work of bees. Bees first gather the nectar at the bottom of flower cups. Bees can't extend their tongues which means that not all flower nectar is accessible to them. That's why some flowers are said to be melliferous.
                    Worker bees start processing the nectar on their way back to the hive by adding an enzyme. Once back at the hive, they pass the nectar back and forth by trophallaxis, adding saliva and digestive juices on each exchange to gradually transform it. This "essential honey" is then stored in cells where it is partially dried and matured by the bees fanning their wings (bzzzzz!).
                    The bees later store it in cells which are sealed with wax to build stores for the winter. Since bees really like to eat, they will continue to store honey as long as they have room...and the flowers continue to produce enough nectar.

                    <p><h2>Royal Jelly</h2>Royal Jelly is a substance produced by young worker bees (bees between five and fourteen days old). Usually called "bee milk" in the beekeeping industry, royal jelly is required for the development of larvae which are all fed the same way until the third day.
                    Only the larvae selected to become queens will be fed royal jelly after the third day. This pearl of the Beehive becomes the Queen's only food and helps her live for five years, on average.
                    As for the larvae, their initial weight increases 1800 times in just a few days. That shows how nourishing Royal Jelly is for bees!
                    The pale yellow, strong-smelling substance contains: lipids, carbohydrates, water, proteins, vitamins and trace elements.

                    <p><h2>Pollen</h2>Pollen is the seed from the reproductive system of plants. When bees collect from flowers, they harvest pollen using their back legs. They mix the pollen with a bit of honey (or nectar) and saliva to create little balls they can bring back to the beehive in their pollen baskets.
                    Once back at the hive, they store it in dedicated cells to make bee bread, also known as ambrosia. It is used to feed the older broods and also as special food for the worker bees who make royal jelly. It is an important source of protein for bees.
                    Note that "bee pollen" (entomophile) and anemophilous pollen (transported by the wind) are very different. Entomophile pollen does not cause allergies. Common pollen allergies are not due to ingestion, but to inhalation. Entomophile pollen allergies are very rare and completely distinct from existing anemophilous pollen allergies.

                    <p><h2>Beeswax</h2>Unlike other hive products, beeswax is a substance produced 100% by worker bees. They produce what are called wax scales thanks to specific glands located on their abdomen. Mixed with saliva, the wax scales take on a more homogeneous and smoother appearance, which then serves as a polishing, protective and softening agent. Like propolis or royal jelly, beeswax plays an important role in maintaining the good health of the hive and protecting it from external aggression.</p>
