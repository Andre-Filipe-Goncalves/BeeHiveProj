                <h1>Why are bees in danger?</h1>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Bees have become increasingly endangered, which is confirmed by the recent reports by world-renowned organisations such as the United Nations, the IUCN or Greenpeace. The 2015 IUCN report states that nearly 10% of bees are facing extinction, and around 5% of them are probably endangered, while no data is available for nearly 57% of species. 
                    The number of pollinators is in decline around the world, while the need for pollination is on the rise, especially in developing countries. In some parts, this situation has become known as ”the pollinator crisis”.</p>

                    <h3>The main reasons for the mortality of bees include:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Varroa mites;</li>
                        <li>Nosema disease and viral infections affecting european adult bees including queen bees;</li>
                        <li>Mass use of pesticides with negative impact on pollinators, especially plant protection products in the neonicotinoids classification;</li>
                        <li>New pests, which spread faster around the world due to globalisation, like some wasp species;</li>
                        <li>Urbanisation;</li>
                        <li>With the loss of bees comes the loss of many plants.</li>
                        <li>The diversity and evolution of insects likely played a major role in the evolution of flowering plants. We could lose this diversity that has developed over hundreds of millions of years in just decades.</li>
                        <li>Pollution and climate change;</li>
                        <li>Global trade of low-quality honey, which impacts the beekeeping economy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As of 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 16 species of bees as vulnerable, 18 as endangered and 9 as critically endangered globally.</p>

                <h1>What are the consequences?</h1>
                <br/>
                <p>If bee families continue to disappear in Europe at current or even higher rates, this could lead to the breakdown of the economy and put our health and well-being at risk.
                In addition to being one of the major pollinators, thus ensuring food and food security, sustainable agriculture and biodiversity, bees significantly contribute to the mitigation of climate change and environmental conservation. In the long-term, the protection of bees and the beekeeping sector can help reduce poverty and hunger, as well as preserve a healthy environment and biodiversity. With the loss of bees comes the loss of many plants.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Scientific studies have proven that bees have become increasingly endangered.  It is only through joint efforts that we can ensure the protection of bees and their habitats. A study published in the journal Lancet predicts that smaller consumption of fruit and vegetables due to climate change which also affects pollinators, will cause twice as many deaths by 2050 than hunger and malnutrition.</p>
