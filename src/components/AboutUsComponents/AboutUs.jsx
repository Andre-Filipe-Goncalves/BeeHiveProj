                <p>We are a team of 4 people, passionate about bees and their importance to our life, as a whole, in this world. Our intention is to bring awareness to the general public about these little workers, which are slowly disappearing. Besides reminding people of why bees are so important to our lives, this website also provides information about the main causes of decline in bee populations around the world, as well as the main ways for us to help restore them and, in the end, save them. By saving the bees, we will also be saving many other species of fauna and flora, and even ourselves in the process.</p>
